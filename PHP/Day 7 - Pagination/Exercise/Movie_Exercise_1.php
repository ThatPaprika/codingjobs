	This exercise is based on the 'movies' exercise.
	
	Now, we have implemented the register/login process into the same project.

	Step 1. Open 'nav.html' and rename it to 'nav.php'
	Step 2. If the user is loggued-in, hide 'login' & 'register' links and display 'account' instead.
	Step 3. If the user is not loggued-in, display 'login' & 'register' links.
