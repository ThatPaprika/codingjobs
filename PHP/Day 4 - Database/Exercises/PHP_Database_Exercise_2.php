	This exercise is based on the exercise : 'PHP_Database_Exercise_1'.
	
	Edit the 'movies.php' page
	Now this page will have a search box -> create an input:text
	
	When the user is typing something and click on 'search' button, you should display all the movies matching the search.

	The search is based on the name of the movie. The user don't have to type the specific name.

	For example :
		User types 'jur', it should display all movies containing 'jur' (ex: jurassic park).

	-- STEP 1 : Create the form
	-- STEP 2 : Check if the button was clicked :
		** If it wasn't, search all movies
		** If it was, search for the specific movie
	-- STEP 3 : Display (already done)
