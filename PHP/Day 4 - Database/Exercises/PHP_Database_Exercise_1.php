/*
	In this exercise, we'll use the 'moviedb' database.
	
	1. Create a page 'index.php'.
	This page will display a nice message like 'Welcome to the freakin movie website' (or whatever)
	Also display only the last three movies (ordered by date of release).

	2. Create a page 'movies.php'.
	This page will display all the movies (poster first, then title and release year).
	
	4. Create a page 'movie.php'.
	This page is a descriptive page for each movie. It'll display the poster, the title, the release year but also the director's name.
	This page will have to use the GET method to get the id of the movie you want to display.
	So in your adress bar it'll look like this : 'localhost/movie.php?id=1'
	You have to get the id of the movie to know which movie to display.
	
	5. Edit the page 'movies.php'
	Make the title of each movie clickable. It'll redirect to the related descriptive movie page.
