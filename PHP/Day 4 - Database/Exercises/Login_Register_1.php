	Let's assume you have an online shopping website.

    In this exercise, you'll have to create a register/login process.
    
    - Step 0 :
		Import the 'users.sql' file into PHPMYADMIN.
		You have to choose a DB first (you can use movie_db or create a new one).

		Some users will be imported into your database.
		You can insert users manually from PHPMYADMIN interface if you want.
    
    - Step 1 :
        Create a 'register.php' file
        This file contains a form with those input :
            * username
            * email
            * password
            * confirm password
            * submit btn
    
    - Step 2 :
        If the form is submitted, you have to check :
            * username, mail and password must not be empty !
            * mail must be a valid one
            * passwords must be the same 

        Display a different message for each validation/error.

    - Step 3 :
        If everything is good, insert the new user in the DB !
