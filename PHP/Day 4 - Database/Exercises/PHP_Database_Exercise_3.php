	Let's continue our movie website.


	BONUS EXERCISE 1 : 

		0. Add a picture attribute on the directors table (you can skip this).

		1. Create a page 'directors.php'
		This page will display all the directors 
		For each directors, you have to display : Picture, name, nationality and number of movies.
	
		2. Create a page 'director.php'.
		This page is a descriptive page for each director. It'll display the picture, name and nationality of the director.
		It'll also display ALL the movies from this director (at least the title).
		This page will have to use the GET method to get the id of the director you want to display.
		So in your adress bar it'll look like this : 'localhost/director.php?id=1'

	BONUS EXERCISE 2 :
		
		1. Create a new page 'new-movie.php'

		2. Create a form on this page to ask for every movie's information (title, views, poster and director_id).

		3. When submitting the form you should : 
			- Make sure every input is not empty.
			- Save the movie inside the DB.

		At the end, this form should be used to insert new movie in the DB.
