	- Exercise 3 :
	
		We have an array of bank transactions, which indicates the credit and debit amounts of each person.
		For each person, calculate the real amount of their account and it as a key/value in the array.

		You have to edit the original array. You can't create a new array.

		$transactions = array(
		    "Marie" => array(
		        "debit"=>6,
		        "credit"=>9
		    ),
		    "Julien" => array(
		        "debit"=>21,
		        "credit"=>19
		    ),
		    "Sophie" => array(
		        "debit"=>15,
		        "credit"=>14
		    ),
		    "John" => array(
		        "debit"=>10,
		        "credit"=>14
		    )
		);

		// Expected results : 
		$transactions = array(
		    "Marie" => array(
		        "debit"=>6,
		        "credit"=>9,
		        "amount"=>3
		    ),
		    "Julien" => array(
		        "debit"=>21,
		        "credit"=>19,
		        "amount"=>-2
		    ),
		    "Sophie" => array(
		        "debit"=>15,
		        "credit"=>14,
		        "amount"=>-1
		    ),
		    "John" => array(
		        "debit"=>10,
		        "credit"=>14,
		        "amount"=>4
		    )
		);

	- Final exercise - ONLY FOR THE BEASTS - BONUS

		We have an array of integers, unsorted, with all numbers from 1 to 50 BUT one element is missing (the array therefore contains 49 elements).
		
		The goal is to find the missing item (the missing number).
		However, you have 3 constraints:
		- You can use as many loops as you want BUT you have the right to iterate/loop the array only once!
		- You have the right to use only one variable !
		- You can use only one function : count()

		An example with an array with 9 elements :

			$array = array(5, 1, 3, 2, 9, 6 ,8, 4, 10);
	        // Le nombre manquant est 7

	        $var = ...

	        for (int i = 0; i < count($array); ++i)
	        {
	            ...
	        }

	        echo "Missing number is: " . $var;
